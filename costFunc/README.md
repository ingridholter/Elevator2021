# Costfunction package

To figure out which elevator that should serve the order we choose to simulate the time used serving the order for each elevator by using timeToIdle. By picking the elevator with the lowest simulation time we could ensure that our system would be efficient and agile. 
This package also contains NewOrderDistributer which creates the message that should be sent to the elevator in the best state for serving the request.
